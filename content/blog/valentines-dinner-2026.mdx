Love is best served at the table. This Valentine's Day, we're transforming our dining room into an intimate candlelit haven for one unforgettable evening.

## What's on the Menu

Our head chef has crafted a **five-course tasting menu** that pairs classic romance with bold, modern flavours:

1. **Amuse-bouche** — Beetroot & goat cheese tartlet with micro herbs
2. **Starter** — Seared scallops with cauliflower purée and truffle oil
3. **Palate cleanser** — Passion fruit & champagne sorbet
4. **Main** — Choose between pan-roasted duck breast with cherry jus or herb-crusted sea bass with saffron risotto
5. **Dessert** — Chocolate fondant for two with raspberry coulis and vanilla bean ice cream

Every couple receives a complimentary glass of champagne on arrival.

## The Atmosphere

We're keeping things intimate with soft acoustic performances throughout the evening. Tables are limited to ensure each couple enjoys a truly private experience — no rushing, no crowds.
