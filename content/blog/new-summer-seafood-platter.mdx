Summer calls for something fresh, light, and straight from the ocean. That's exactly what our new Seafood Platter delivers.

## What's on the Platter

Built for sharing (or not — we won't judge), the Summer Seafood Platter brings together the best of the season:

- **Half dozen oysters** — Freshly shucked, served on ice with mignonette and lemon
- **King prawns** — Grilled with garlic butter and a hint of chilli
- **Lobster tail** — Split and char-grilled, served with drawn butter
- **Catch of the day** — Pan-seared market fish with herb crust
- **Sides** — House slaw, grilled corn, and warm sourdough

Everything is sourced from local fishermen and prepared to order. No shortcuts.

## The Story Behind the Dish

Our head chef spent weeks working with local suppliers to build a platter that celebrates what's in season right now. The result is a dish that changes subtly week to week depending on the freshest catch available.

## Pairing Suggestions

Our sommelier recommends:

- **White:** A crisp Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc pairs beautifully with the oysters and prawns
- **Rosé:** A dry Provençal rosé for those who want something light with the lobster
- **Beer:** A cold pilsner or wheat beer if you're keeping things casual

## Availability

The Summer Seafood Platter is available for lunch and dinner service, **now through the end of March**. It's priced at $85 for two or $55 for a solo portion.
