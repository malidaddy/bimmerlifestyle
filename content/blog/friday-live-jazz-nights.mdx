There's something about live jazz that turns a good evening into a memorable one. We're bringing it back every Friday starting this month.

## What to Expect

From 7 PM, our lounge transforms into a jazz venue featuring a rotating lineup of local and guest musicians. Think smooth saxophone, soulful vocals, and the kind of piano that makes you forget it's a weeknight tomorrow.

The music runs until 10:30 PM, giving you a full evening to unwind.

## Food & Drink

Our bar team has put together a dedicated **Jazz Night cocktail menu** with four signature drinks crafted to complement the mood:

- **The Blue Note** — Gin, blue curaçao, elderflower tonic
- **Velvet Swing** — Bourbon, honey, smoked rosemary
- **Satin Sour** — Vodka, passion fruit, lime foam
- **The Standard** — Classic Old Fashioned, done right

Pair your drinks with our small plates menu — think charcuterie boards, truffle fries, and grilled flatbreads.

## No Cover Charge

That's right — there's no entry fee. Just walk in, grab a seat, and enjoy the music. We do recommend arriving early as lounge seating fills up fast.
